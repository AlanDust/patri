# README

Patri is a simple web application that I am developing as a present for my girlfriend, Patri.  

The application is set up so that an artist can sign up and possibly eventually add their own artwork.  However, I decided that I would stick with the artwork of Patri.  This was mainly an exercise in reinforcing my React, MVC, PostgreSQL, CSS, and Ruby on Rails knowledge, while making a nice product for someone I care about.  

A link to this website, along with usage instructions will be available when the application is deployed to Heroku.  

Technologies Utilized: 
Ruby 2.4.5

AWS
